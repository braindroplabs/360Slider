## *Notes

This project is a simple rich prototype and could easily be culled from to create a more flexible/dynamic solution (utilize SVG vs. .png, make it a jQuery plugin, % based CSS, etc.). I just wanted to create a quick rich prototype that had some appeal to get a better feel of the interaction/behavior. Feel free to take it to the next level.
